 /*Expanding on what you have learned, write a program that
lists the instructions for a computer to find the upstairs
bathroom, discussed in §1.1.Can you think of any more steps
that a person would assume, but that a computer would not?
Add them to your list.This is a good start in “thinking like a
computer.” Warning : For most people, “go to the bathroom” is
a perfectly adequate instruction.For someone with no
experience with houses or bathrooms(imagine a stone - age
	person, somehow transported into your dining room) the list of
	necessary instructions could be very long.Please don’t use
	more than a page.For the benefit of the reader, you may add a
	short description of the layout of the house you are imagining.*/
